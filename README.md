# PredictionResultsViewer

PredictionResultsViewer is used to view results from testing a predictor where the results
can come from either a separate test set (e.g. the KNN or WeightedVoting algorithm) or a
cross-validation prediction (e.g., the KNNXValidation or WeightedVotingXValidation
algorithms).
